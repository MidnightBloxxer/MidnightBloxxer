# @what-is-a-git

i do mostly game dev related stuff atm

mostly like using godot, c, c++, and go atm, but will work with
other stuff when needed or if trying something new (currently other langs like zig)

mostly doing my own thing but sometimes i contribute
to other stuff i guess

i also have a [personal website](https://goddess.nekoweb.org) if you find that kind of thing interesting
